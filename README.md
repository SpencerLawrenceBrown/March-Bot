# Chatbot for Organizing Marches
A prototype for a chat bot concept enabling march participants to receive updates and information about march location, routes, start time, organizers, etc.

Created as a side project / prototype after consistently having difficulty finding information while marching in New York City. Facebook and twitter were often too disorganized and slow to provide timely information, making it hard to understand how the marches were evolving as they moved through the city. 

Essentially a digital megaphone that could respond to each participants individual questions.
